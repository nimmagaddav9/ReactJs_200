200 React JS Interview Q & A

React Basics-1
Q1. What is React? What is the Role of React in software development?
React is open source Javascript Library.
React is used for building user interfaces(UI).
React Simplifies the creation of SPA by using reusable components.

Q2 what are the key Features of React?
7 key features:
1. Virtual DOM
2. Component based architecture
3. Reusability & Composition
4. JSX (Javascript XML)
5. Declarative Syntax
6. Community & Ecosystem
7. React Hooks.
Virtual DOM: React utilizes a virtual representation of the DOM, allowing efficient updates by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM, resulting in improved performance.

Component-Based Architecture: React structures user interfaces as modular, reusable components, promoting a more maintainable and scalable approach to building applications.

Reusability & Composition: React enables the creation of reusable components that can be composed together, fostering a modular and efficient development process.

JSX(JavaScript XML): JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React, allowing developers to write HTML like code within JavaScript, enhancing readbility and maintainability.

Declarative Syntax: React have a declarative programming style(JSX), where developers focus on "what" the UI should like and React handles the "how" behind the scenes. This simplify the code.

Community & Ecosystem: React benifits from a vibrant and extensive community, contributing to a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools and resources, fostering collaborative development and innovation.

React Hooks: Hooks are functions that enable functional components to manage state and lifecycle features, providing a more concise and expressive way to handle component logic.



Q3 what is DOM? What is the difference between HTML & DOM?

DOM(Document Object Model) represents the web page as a tree-like structure which allows Javscript to dynamically access and manipulate the content and structure of a web page.


Q4 What is virtual DOM ? Difference between DOM & Virtual DOM?

React uses a virtual DOM to efficently update the UI without re-render the entire page, which helps improve performance and make the application more responsive.

Reconciliation (React Libraries)

DOM                                                 Virtual DOM
1. DOM is actual representation of the webpage.      1. Virtual DOM is lightweight copy of the DOM.
2. Re-renders the entire page when updates occur.    2. Re-render only the changed parts efficently.
3. Can be slower, especially with frequent updates.  3. Optimized for faster rendering.
4. Suitable for static websites and simple applications 4. ideal for dynamic and complex single-page applications with frequent updates.


Q5 What are React Components? What are the main elements of it?

In React, a component is a reusable building block for creating user interfaces.

//1. Import the React Library
import React from "react";

2. Define a functional component
function Component(){
    //3. Return JSX to describe the component's UI
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>i am a react reusable component</h1>
        </div>
    );
}
//4. Import the component to make it available
//for use in other files
export default component;

Q6 What is SPA (Single Page Application)?

A Single Page Application(SPA) is a web application that have only one single web page.
whenever user do some action on the website, then in response content is dynamically updated without refreshing or loading a new page.

Q7 What are the 5 advantages of React?

1. Simple to build Single Page Application(by using Components - component based architecture).
2. React is cross platform and open source(Free to use)
3. Lightweight and very fast(Virtual DOM)
4. Large Community and Ecosystem.
5. Testing is easy.

Q8 What are the disadvantages of React?
React is not a good choice for very small applications.

Q9 What is the role of JSX in React? (3 points)

1. JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
2. JSX is used by React to write HTML-Like code.
3. JSX is converted to Javscript via tools like Babel.(Because browsers understand JavaScript not JSX.)


Q10 what is the difference between Declarative & Imperative Syntax?

Declarative                                                         
1. Declarative syntax focuses on describing the desired result without specifying the step-by-step process.
2. JSX in React is used to write declarative syntax.

Imperative
1. Imperative syntax involves step by step process to achieve a particular goal.
2. Javascript has an imperative syntax.

React Basics-2 
Q11 What is Arrow Function Expression in JSX?

The arrow function expression syntax is a concise way of defining functions.

//Arrow function Expression
const ArrowFunc = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{props.name}</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

export default ArrowFunc;


Q12 How to Setup React first project?

1. Install Node.js from link. nodejs.org

2. Install code editor for writing the code. VS Code link --> download

3.  Open VS Code --> terminal --> npx create-react-app my-app --> takes 5-6 minutes

4. VS code --> file --> open folder --> MY-APP --> open terminal --> npm start


Q13 What are the Main files in React project?

        Request    
Browser  ---->      index.html --> Single Page

                       ^ >        
          <-----      index.js--> entry point(JS)
        Display             ^
comp1.js, comp2.js, comp3.js -----App.js ==> Root Component

Q14 How React app Load & display the components in browser?

index.html --> Single page which loads index.js by React libraries.

index.js --> Replace root element of index.html file by App component

App.js --> Root Component which is the container of all the child components.

child component.js --> custom child components placed over app component.


Q15 What is the difference between React & Angular?

React                                                                   Angular
React and Angular both are used to create single page UI applications using components.
1. React is a Javascript Library.                                   1. Angular is a complete Framework.
2. React uses virtual DOM which makes it faster.                    2. Angular uses a real DOM.
3. React is smaller in sixe and lightwight and therefore faster sometime.  3. Angular is bigger because it is a complete framework.
4. React depends on external libraries for many complex features, so      4. Since Angular is a complete framework, therfore it provide built-in support for features like routing, forms, validation and HTTP requests.
developer has to write many lines of code for complex functionalities

5. React is simple to learn and more popular than Angular.              5. Angular is slightly difficult to learn as it has Typescipt, OOPS concept and many more thing.


Q16 What are the other 5 JS frameworks other than React?

Angular
Vue.js
AngularJS
Backbone.js
Ember.js

Q17 Whether React is Framework or Library? what is the difference?

Library: Developers import the libraties at the top and then used it functions in components.
React is commonly reffered to as a Javscript Library

Framework: Developers need to follow a specific structure or pattern defined by the framework.
Angular is a framework.

@Component({
    selector:'app-root',
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrls:['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent{
    title = "Hello World";
}


Q18 How React provide Reusability & Composition?
React provides Reusability and Composition through its component-based architecture.
Reusability: once you create a component, you can re-use it in different parts of your application or even in multiple projects.
Composition: Composition is creating new and big components by Components by combining existing small components. Its advantage is, change to one small component will not impact other components.


Q19 What are State, Stateless, Stateful and state management teams?

"State" refers to the current data of the component.

Stateful or state management means when a user performs some actions on the UI, then the React application should be able to update and re-render the data or state on the UI.


Q20 What are Props in JSX?
Props(properties) are way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

React Basics-3 
Q21 What is NPM? What is the role of node_module folder?
NPM(Node Package Manager) is used to manage dependencies for your React project, including the React Library itself.

node_modules folder contains all the dependencies of the project, including the React libraries.



Q22 What is the role of public folder in React?
Public folder contains static assets that are served directly to the user's browser, such as images, fonts, and the index.html file.



Q23 What is the role of src folder in React?

src folder is used to store all the source code of the application which is then responsible for the dynamic changes in your web application.


Q24 What is the role of index.html page in React?

index.html file is the main HTML file(SPA) in React application.
here the div with id="root" will be replaced by the component inside index.js file.


Q25 What is the role of index.js file & ReactDOM in React?

ReactDOM is a Javascript library that renders components to the DOM or browser.

The index.js file is the javascript file that replaces the root element of the index.html file with the newly rendered components.


Q26 What is the role of App.js file in React?

App.js file contain the root component(App) of React Application.

App Component is like a container for other components.

App.js defines the structure, layout, and routing in the application.


Q27 What is the role of function & return inside App.js?

1. The function keyword is used to define a JavaScript function that represent your React component.
2. function is like a placeholder which contains all the code or logic of component.
3. The function takes in props as its argument(if needed) and return JSX.
return is used to return the element from the function.

Q28 Can we have function without a return inside App.js?

Yes, a function without a return statement is possible.
In that case, your component will not render anything in UI.
The common use case is for logging purpose.

Using arrow function

const FuncWithoutReturn = ()=>{
    console.log("no return");
}

Q29 What is the role of export default inside App.js?
Export statement is used to make a component available for import using "import" statement in other files.

import React from "react";

const AppChild = (props) =>{
    return <h1>hi</h1>
}

export default AppChild;


Q30 Does the file name & component name must be same in React?

No, the file name and the component name don't have to be the same.
However, it is recommended to keep the same for easier to organize and understand your code.

React -4 JSX

Q31 What is the role of JSX in React? (3 points)

1. JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
2. JSX is used by React to write HTML-Like code.
3. JSX is converted to Javscript via tools like Babel.(Because browsers understand JavaScript not JSX.)

function App(){
    return(
        <div className="App">
            <h1>Hello!</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

Q32 What are the 5 Advantages of JSX?

1. Improve code readability and writability
2. Error checking in advance(Type safety)
3.support JavaScript expressions
4. Improved performance
5. code Reusability.


Q33 What is Babel?

Babel in React is used to transpile JSX syntax into regular Javscript which browser can understand.


Q34 What is the role of Fragment in JSX?

In React, a fragment is a way to group multiple children's elements.
Using a Fragment prevents the addition of unnecessary nodes to the DOM.

<Fragment>
<div>vijay</div>
<div>reactjs</div>
</Fragment>

Q35 What is Spread Operator in JSX?

The Spread operator(...) is used to expand or spread an array or object.

function App() {
    const props = {name: "vijay", id:1};
    return (
        <ChildComponent {...props}/>
    );
}

function ChildComponent(props){
    return <div>{props.name},{props.id}</div>;
}


Q36 What are the types of Conditional Rendering in JSX?

Conditional Rendering

1. If /else statements 

2. Ternary Operator

3. && operator  - returns truthy value.

4. Switch statement


Q37 How do you iterate over a list in JSX? What is map() method?

map() method allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function.


Q38 Can a browser read a JSX file?

No, browsers cannot directly interpret or understand JSX files. 
Babel takes JSX and converts it into equivalent Javascript code that browsers can understand.


Q39 What is Transpiler? What is the difference between Compiler & Transpiler?

A Transpiler is a tool that converts source code from one high-level programming lanaguage(JSX) to another high-level programming language(JavaScript).
Ex: Babel.

A Compiler is a tool that converts high-level programming language (Java) into a lower-level language(machine code or byte code).


Q40 Is it possible to use JSX without React? 

Yes, it's possible to use JSX without React by creating your own transpiler like Babel.
However, this is not recommended since JSX is tightly integrated with React and relies on many React-specific features.


React- 5 Components-Functional/Class

Q41 What are React Components ? what are the main elements of it?

In React, a component is a reusable building block for creating user interfaces.

//1. Import the React Library
import React from "react";

//2. Define a functional component
function Component(){
    //3. Return JSX to describe the component's UI
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>react reusable component</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

//4. Export the component to make it available
// for use in other files
export default Component;

Q42 What are the Types of React Components? What are Functional Components?

Types of Components

1. Functional Components: They are declared as a JavaScript function. 
They are stateless component, but with the help of hooks, they can now manage state also.

2. Class Components

Q43 How do you pass data between functional components in React?

props(properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

Q44 What is Prop Drilling in React?
Prop drilling is the process of passing down props through multiple layers of components.


Q45 Why to Avoid Prop Drilling? In how many ways avoid Prop Drilling?
1. Maintenance: Prop drilling can make code harder to maintain as changes in data flow require updates across multiple components.
2. Complexity: It increases code complexity and reduces code reability.
3. Debugging: Debugging becomes challenging when props need to be traced through numerous components.

5 ways to avoid Prop Drilling

1. Using Context API
2. using Redux
3. using Component Composition
4. using Callback Functions
5. Using Custom Hooks

Q46 What are class components in React?

1. Class Components are defined using JavaScript classes.
2. They are stateful components by using the lifecycle methods.
3. The render method in a class component is responsible for returning JSX.


import React, {Component} from 'react';

class AppClass extends Component{
    render(){
        return<h1>hello</h1>;
    }
}
export default AppClass;


Q47 How to pass data between class components in React?

this.props can be used in child component to access properties/data passed from parent component.


class ParentComponent extends Component{
    render(){
        const dataToSend = "hello from parent";
        return(
            <div>
                <ChildComponent message={dataToSend} />
            </div>
        );
    }
}
export deault ParentComponent;



class ChildComponent extends Component{
    render(){
        return(
            <div>
                <p>Message:{this.props.message}</p>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default ChildComponent;

//output: Message: hello from parent



Q48 What is the role of this keyword in class components?

this keyword is used to refer to the instance of the class.


Q49 What are the 5 differences btw Functional components & class components? 

Functional Component                                                     Class Component

1. Syntax: Defined as JS function.                                      1. Defined as a JS(Es6) class.
2. State: Orginally stateless but can now maintain state using hooks.   2. Can Manage local state with this.state.
3. Lifecycle methods: No                                                3. Yes
4. Readbility: more readable & Concise.                                 4. Verbose(complex).
5. this keyword: No                                                     5. Yes(Access props using this.props)
6. Do not have render method.                                           6. have render method.


React- 6 Routing

Q50 What is Routing and Router in React?
Routing: Routing allows you to create a single-page web application with navigation, without the need for a full-page refresh.
React Router: React Router is a library for handling routing and enables navigation and rendering of different component based on the URL.


Q51 How to implement Routing in React?
Command to install router:
npm install react-router-DOM

Step1: Install React Router
Step2: Create navigation
Step3: Create Routes


Q52 What are the roles of <Routes> & <Route> component in React Routing?
The <Routes> Component is used as the root container for declaring your collection of routes.
The <Route> component is used to define a route and specify the component that should render when the route matches.
for example, if user enter websitename.com/about in url then matching "About" component will be rendered.

Q53 What are Route Parameters in React Routing?
Route parameters in React Router are a way to pass dynamic values(data) to the component as part of the URL path.

// userId is the route parameters
<Route path="/users/:userId" component={userProfile}/>


Q54 What is the role of Switch Component in React Routing?
Switch component ensures that only the first matching<Route> is rendered and rest is ignored.
Example: Switch is commonly used to handle 404 or not found routes.

Q55 What is the role of exact prop in React Routing?
exact prop is used with the <Route> component to match exactly to the provided path.

//with exact
//only match about
<Route path="/about" exact component={About} />     note: not supporting "/anout/team, /about/contact 


React- 7 Hooks -useState/useEffect

Q56 What are React Hooks? What are the Top React Hooks?
1. React Hooks are inbuilt functions provided by React that allow functional components to useState and lifecycle features.
2. Before Hooks, class components lifecycle methods were used to maintain state in React Applications.
3. To use React hook first we first have to import it from React Library.

//import React, {UseState} from "react":
useState: State
UseEffect: side effects
useContext: Context
useReducer: Complex State
useCallback: Memoization
useMemo: Performance
useRef: Refs  
useLayoutEffect: Synchornous Side effects.


Q57 What are State, Stateless, Stateful and State Management terms?
"state" refers to the current data of the component.
Stateful or statemanagement means, when a user performs some actions on the UI, then the React application should be able to update and re-render that data or state on the UI.


Q58 What is the role of useState() hook and how it works?

The useState hook enables functional components to manage state.
useState() working: useState() function accept the initial state value as the parameter and returns an array with 2 elements:
1. The first element is the current state value(count in this code).
2. Second element is the function that is used to update the state(setCount in this code).
The concept of assign array elements to individual variables is called array destructing.

import React, {useState} from "react";
function UseState(){
    //array destructing
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    const increment = () =>{
        setCount(count + 1);
    }
}

return (
    <div>
    <p>Count:{count}</p>
        <button onClick={increment}>Click</button>
    </div>
);
export default UseState;


Q59 What is the role of useEffect(). How it works & what is its use?

The useEffect Hook in React is used to perform side effects in functional components.
For example, data fetching from API, subscriptions or any other operation that needs to be performed after the component has been rendered.

Q60. What is useEffect() hook and when to use it?
useEffect()  is called after the component renders. Example: side effects.
useEffect() function will accept 2 parameter: (Effect function, dependency array)

Q61 What is Dependency Array in useEffect() hook?
Dependecies array(optional) act as triggers for useEffect to rerun;meaning if any of the dependencies values change, the code inside useEffect() will be executed again.
Ex: userId --> due to multiple dependencies

Q62 What is the meaning of the empty array[] in the useEffect()?
An Empty array[] indicates that the effect function should only run once.

React- 8 Hooks -useContext/useReducer

Q63 What is the role of useContext() hook?
useContext in React provides a way to pass data from parent to child component without using props.
avoid prop drilling.


Q64 What is createContext() method? what are Provider & Consumer Properties?
createContext() function returns an object with Provider and Consumer properties.
The Provider property is responsible for providing the context value to all its child components.
useContext() method or Consumer property can be used to consume the context value in child components.


Q64 When to use useContext hook instead of props in real application?
Use useContext instead of props when you want to avoid prop drilling and access context values directly within deeply nested components.

Props are good from component 1 --> component 2
useContext is good for multiple components  Ex: Comp1--> Comp2--> Comp3 -->Comp4

Advantages:
1. Theme Switching(Dark/Light): you can centralize and pass the theme selection of the application from the parent to all the deep child components.
2. Localization(language selection): you can centralize and pass the language selection of the application from the parent to all the child components.
3. Centralize Configure settings: Common configuration settings like API endpoints can be centralized and change in the parent component will pass the setting to all its child components.
4. User Preferences: Any other user preferences apart from theme and localization can also be centralized.
5. Notification System: Components that trigger or display notifications can access the notification state from the context.

React- 11 Component LifeCycle Method-1 

Q65 What are component life cycle phases? 3

Component Life cycle Phases.
1. Mounting Phase. (Component creation started) - This phase occurs when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
2. Updating Phase (Component updates): This phase occurs when a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.
3. Unmounting Phase(Removal from the DOM): This phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM.


Q66 What are component life cycle methods?

Component lifecycle methods are special methods that get called at various stages of a component's life.
Mounting Phase:
=====================
1. constructor()
2. getDerivedStateFromProps()
3. render()
4. componentDidMount()

Updating Phase
====================
render()
componentDidUpdate()
getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()

Unmounting Phase
========================
componentWillUnmount()



Q67 What are constructors in class components ? when to use them?

Mounting Phase
===============
Constructor()

constructor is a special method that is called when an instance of the class is created.
Constructor is used to intializing the component's state or performing any setup that is needed before the component is rendered.

Q68 What is the role of super keyword in constructor?

super keyword is used in the constructor of a class component to call the constructor of the parent class.
This is necessary to ensure that the initialization logic of the parent class is executed.

class ConstructorExample extends Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);

        //Initalize the State
        this.state = {
            count: 0,
        ;}
    }
    render(){
        return(
            <h2> Count:{this.state.count}</h2>
        );
    }
}

export default ConstructorExample;


Q69 what is the role of render() method in component life cycle?

Mounting Phase, Updating Phase -- render()

Render() method returns the React elements that will be rendered to the DOM.


Q70 How the state can be maintained in a class component?

Two step process to maintain state:

1. this.setState() method is used to update the state.
2. this.state property is used to render the update state in DOM.

class StateComponent extends Component{
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            count: 0; //initializing the state
        };
    }
    render(){
        return(
            <div>
                <h2>Counter: {this.state.count}</h2>
                <button onClick={this.handleInc}>Increment</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
    handleInc = () =>{
        this.setState((prevState)=>({
            count: prevState.count + 1,
        }));
    };
}

export default StateComponent;

Q71 What is the role of componentDidMount() method in component life cycle?

ComponentDidMount() lifecycle method in React is the part of mounting phase and is called after a component has been rendered to the DOM.
Mostly used for side effects. For example, external data fetching or setting up subscriptions.

Mounting Phase
===============
componentDidMount()

1. Rendered after constructor intialization.
2. Rendered after componentDidMount() to run side effects(ex: loading data from external API) and then call render() method of updating phase again.


React- 13 Controlled & Uncontrolled Components

Q72 What are controlled components in React?
A controlled component is a component whose form elements(like input fields or checkboxes) are controlled by the state of the application.


Q73 What are the differences btw Controlled & Uncontrolled components?

Controlled Components                                               Uncontrolled Components
1. Values are controlled by React State.                            1.Values are not controlled by React State.
2. Event handlers update React state.                               2. No explicit state update; values can be accessed directly from the DOM.
3. Don't depend on useRef()                                         3. Commonly uses useRef() to access form element values.
4. Re-renders on state changes.                                     4. Less re-rendering since values are not directly tied to React state.
5. A recommended and standard practice for form handling in React.  5. useful in certain scenarios but less commonly considered a best pratice.


Q74 What are characteristics of controlled components?

characteristics of controlled components:
1. State Control: The value of the form element is stored in the component's state.
2. Event Handling: Changes to the form element trigger an event(e.g., onChange for input fields)
3. State Update: The event handler updates the component's state with the new value of the form element.
4. Re-rendering: The Component re-renders with the updated state, and the form element reflects the new value.

Q75 What are the advantages of using controlled components in React forms?

Top 3 benefits of using controlled components in React forms:
1. In controlled components, form elements have their values managed by React State, ensuring a single source of truth.
2. This approach facilitated predicatable and synchronized updates, making it easier to implement features such as form validation, and dynamic rendering, and seamless integration with React's lifecyle methods.
3. Controlled Components offer better control and maintainability compared to uncontrolled components, making them the best pratice for handling forms in React applications.


Q76 How to handle forms in React?
The preferred and recommended approach for handling forms in React is by Using controlled components.


Q77 How can you handle multiple input fields in a controlled form?
Maintain separate state variables for each input field and update them individually using the onChange event.


Q78 How do you handle form validation in a controlled component?
By using conditional rendering based on the state and validate input values before updating the state.

Q79 In what scenarios might using uncontrolled components be advantageous?
Uncontrolled components can be beneficial when integrating with non-React libraries, or when dealing with forms where controlled components are not possible.


*** React- 14 Code Splitting 

Q80 What is code splitting in React?
Code splitting is a technique to split the JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks, which are loaded on-demand.

Q81 How to implement code splitting in React?
3 steps for code splitting in React:
1. Use React.lazy() to lazily import components.
2. wrap components with Suspense to handle loading.
3. Configure your build tool(e.g webpack) for dynamic imports.

Q82 What is the role of Lazy & Suspense methods in React?
React.lazy is a function that allows you to load a component lazily.
It enables code splitting by allowing you to import a component asynchronously/dynamically, meaning component is loaded only when needed only.

The Suspense component is used to display a fallback UI while the lazily loaded component is being fetched.


Q83 What are the Pros & Cons of code splitting?

5 Pros of Code Splitting:
1. Faster Initial Load Time:  Code splitting reduces the initial load time of your application by only loading the necessary code for the current view or feature. Good for performance.
2. Optimized Bandwidth Usage: By Loading only, the code needed for a specific page, it reduces the amount of data transferred over the network. Good for slow network.
3. Improved caching: Smaller, more focused code chunks are more likely to be cached by the browser.
4. parallel loading: Multiple smaller chunks can be loaded simuntaneously, leading to faster overall loading times.
5. Easier Maintenance: Code splitting can make your codebase more modular, independent and easier to maintain.

5 Cons of code splitting:
1. Complexity: Implementing code splitting introduces additional complexity to your application. This complexity can make the development process slow.
2. Tooling Dependecies: Proper code splitting often requires specific build tools and configurations, such as Webpack and Babel. Managing these tools is challenging.
3. Potential for Runtime Errors: Dynamically loading code at runtime can introduce the possibility of runtime errors. careful testing is necessary to catch such issues.
4. Increased Number of Requests: Code splitting may increase the number of HTTP requests needed to fetch all the necessary chunks. This can impact performance.
5: Learning Curve: Developers who are new to code splitting may need time to understand the concepts and best practices. This can be a challenging.


Q84 What is the role of the import() function in code splitting?
The import() function returns a promise that allow dynamic loading of modules.

Q85 What is the purpose of the fallback prop in Suspense?
The fallback prop provides a loading indicator or UI while the dynamically imported component is being loaded.

Q86 Can you dynamically load css files using code splitting in React?
Yes, using dynamic import() for CSS files allows you to load styles on-demand along with the corresponding components.

Q87 How do you inspect & analyze the generated chunks in React application?
Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to analyze the size and composition of chunks.

*** React- 15 Others

Q88 What is a higher-order component in React?
A Higher-Order Component is a component which takes another component as an argument and adds extra features to another component.
HOC can be used for providing logging functionality to all the components in a reusable way.


Q89 What are the 5 Ways to Style React components ? Explain inline styles?

5. Deployed as web applications.                                5. Deployed through app stores(e.g., App store, Google Play)


Q91 What is GraphQL?
GraphQL is a query language for APIs(Application Programming Interfaces) and a runtime for executing those queries with your exisitng data.
GraphQL and React are often used together. React components can use GraphQL queries to fetch the data required for rendering.

Q98 What are the Top 3 ways to achieve state management? when to use what in React?
1. useState Hook: 
    When to use: Simple component-level state.
    Reason: Ideal for applications having small components and isolated state because it is Lightweight and built into React only.
2. Context API:
    When to use: Prop drilling avoidance for sharing global data.
    Reason: Simplifies data passing through the component tree, reducing the need for manual prop drilling.
3. Redux:
    When to use: Large-scale applications with complex state.
    Reason: Centralized store and actions provide a predicatable state management pattern, aiding in debugging and scalability.

Q92 How can you implement authentication in a React application?

Front-end/Client-side                                               Middleware/server-side/backend(node.js, asp.net, django)

browser                     1. POST:{username, password}           2. authenticate & create JWT Token
                            3. Return Response {JWT token}
4. Store JWT token at local storage
                            5. Request Data{JWT token: Header}     6. Validate token signature

                            7. Send Data
8. Display data on browser

Q93 What is the use of React Profiler?
React Profiler is a set of tools in React that allows developers to profile(analyze) the performance of a React application.


Q94 What is the difference between Fetch & Axios for API calls in React?

Fetch                                                                                                   Axios
1. fetch is a built-in JS function, so doesn't require any additional libraires.                        1. Axios is a third-party library, that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests.
2. fetch returns Promises, making it easy to work with asynchromous code using async/await syntax.      2. Axios allows you to use interceptors, which can be good for tasks like request/response logging, authentication, and error handling.
3. If you want to keep http requests simple, fetch is a good choice.                                    3. If you want to intercept http request/response or improve error handling then Axios has more features to do it.


Q95 What are the popular Testing Libraries for React?

Jest
React Testing Library

Cypress

Q96 How can you Optimize Performance in React application?
1. Memoization with useMemo and useCallback:  Use this hooks to memoize values and, reducing unnecessary recalculations.
2. Optimizing Renders with React.Fragment: Use it to avoid unnecessary wrapper elements that could cause additional DOM nodes.
3. Lazy loading with React.lazy: Use it to load components lazily, reducing the intial bundle size and imporving intial loading performance.
4. Code splitting: Employ code splitting to divide your application into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, improving initial load times.
5. Optimizing Images and Assets:  Compress and optimize images, use responsive images and leverage lazy loading for images to reduce network and rendering overhead.


Q97 Explain Reactive Programming with example?
Reactive programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on reacting to changes and events in a declarative and asynchronous manner.
Ex: Google search type --> gives hints --> events are captured.

Declarative means a programming style where you write the code for what you want to achieve, rather than specifying step-by-step how to achieve it.
For Ex: JSX in React has declarative syntax.

Asynchronously means an action that doesn't block other actions.

Q98 In how many ways can we implement Reactive Programming in React?

1. State and Props: Reacting to changes in local component state and passing data reactively through props.
2. React Hooks: Leveraging useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and side effects in functional components.
3. Event Handling: Reacting to user interactions through event handling and updating state accordingly.
4. Context API: sharing and managing global state reactively across components using the Context API.
5. Redux: using state management libraries like Redux for managing complex application state reactively.
6. Component LifeCycle Methods: Using class components and lifecycle methods for handling side effects and updates.
7. Async/await: utilizing async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations reactively.
8. RxJS and Observables: Levering RxJS for handling aysnchronous operations and data streams in a reactive manner.

Q99 How to pass data from child component to parent component in React?
Parent provides a callback function to child and then child component can then invoke this callback to pass data back to the parent.


======================================================================================================================================

ReactJS Interview Question and Answers

1. What is react.js?
   React is an open-source Javascript library developed for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications.

2. What are the major features of react?
   Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations.
   JSX: JSX stands for Javascript and XML, which allow writing HTML in React components.
   Components: React is Component-based, meaning the UI is built using reusable components.
   One-way Data Binding: Data flows in one direction, making the application easier to understand and debug.
   High Performance: React Optimizes updates by using a virtual DOM and efficently re-rendering components.
   Undirectional Data Flow: Data flows in a single direction, which provides better control over the entire application.

3. What is Virtual DOM and how it works?

Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React Components.
React keeps a copy of the actual DOM structure in memory, called the virtual DOM, and uses it to optimize updates and rendering.

Rendering -----> Updating ----> Diffing Algorithm -----> Batch Updates -----> Reconciliation

4. What are components in react?
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be nested, managed, and handled independently.
Class Based Components 
Functional Components

5. Explain Class components with example?

class nameofComponent extends component then render method return JSX.

import React, {Component} from 'react;
class ClassComponentExample extends Component {
    render(){
        return <h1>Hello</h1>;
    }
}
export default ClassComponentExample;

4. Explain functional components with example?

2-ways

import React from 'react';

function FunctionalComponent() { // function keyword
    return <h1>Hello</h1>
}
export default FunctionalComponent;

import React from 'react';
const FunctionalComponent = () => { //const arrow function
    return <h1>hello</h1>
}
export default FunctionalComponent;

5. What is JSX?
JSX stands for Javascript XML.
It allows us to write HTML elements in Javascript and place them in the DOM without using methods like createElement() or appendChild().

6. How to export and import components?
we can export components using export default or named exports, and import them using import.
inorder to reuse a component we need to export.

exportcomponent1.js

import react from "react";

const Home = () =>{
    return <h1>Home!</h1>;
};

export default Home;


=================

importcomponent1.js

import React from "react";
import Home from "./home";

const App = () =>{
    return (
        <div>
        <Home />
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;

7. How to use nested components?

Header component --> common for layout. <Menu /> is nested inside header.
App Component --> nested <Header /> component

8. What is state in react ?

button --> counter value  1-->2 --> 3 value is stored in state.

In React, state is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change. 
Each component can have its own state, which can be managed within the component and used to render the UI.
When the state changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the new state.

9. What is state in react?

import React, {Component} from "react";
//class based component
class Counter extends Component {
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        //Initializing state
        this.state ={
            count: 0;
        };
    }
    render() {
        return(
        <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        );
    }
}
export default Counter;


-----------------------------
//functional based component
import React, {useState} from "react";  //useState
function Counter(){
    //Initializing state using useState Hook
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  //update state with setCount

    return (
        <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
    );
}
export default Counter;

=========================================
//class component
import React, {Component} from "react";
class Counter extends Component {
    state = {
        count: 0
    }
    render(){
        return(
            <h1> Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
        )
    }
}
export default Counter; toow  


10. How to update state in react?
State in React is updated using the setState method in class components or the useState hook in functional components.
// class
this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1})

//functional
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

11. What is setState Callback?
The setState method can accept a callback function as the second argument, which is executed once the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered.

12. Why you should not update state directly, explain wiht example?
Updating state directly does not trigger a re-render of the component, leading to inconsistencies in the UI.
Instead, always use setState (class-based) or state(functional-based) hooks.

13. What are props in react?
Props(properties) are used to pass data and event handlers to child component.(communicate b/w components)
props ensure a one-way data flow, from parent to child.
props cannot be modified by the child component that receives them. (read-only)

Example:
import React from "react";

//child component
function Greeting(props){
    return <h1>hello, {props.name}!</h1>
}

//parent component
function App(){
    return(
        <div>
        <Greeting name="vijay" />
        <Greeting name="krishna" />
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
==============================

14. What is difference between state and props ?

       state                                            
    State is built-in object used to store data that may change over the lifecycle of a component.
    It is managed within the component itself.

    State is mutable. 
    It can be updated using the setState method in class components or the useState hook in functional components.

    State is local to the component and cannot be accessed or modified by child components.

    Props
    Props(properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
    They are read-only and immutable within the child component.

    Props are immutable. Once passed to child component, they cannot be modified by the child.

    Props are passed from parent component to a child component and can be accessed by the child.


15. What is lifting state up in react?
Lifting State Up is a pattern in React where state is moved up to the closest common ancestor of components that need to share that state.
Single Source of Truth: By managing the state in the parent component, you can ensure that the state is consistent across multiple child components.
Simplified State Management: The state logic is centralized, making it easier to maintain and debug.

Parent <----- child (button). Manage state in single parent component.

16. What is children prop in react?
The children prop is a special property in React used to pass the content that is nested inside a component.

Child Component --> {props.children}
Parent Component --> App() <h1> <p><h2><button>

17. What is defaultProps in React?
defaultProps is used to set default values for the props in a component.

Greeting.defaultProps ={
    name: "Guest",
}
//usage
<Greeting /> //renders "hello, guest"

18. What are fragments in react and its advantages?
Fragments allow you to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
<React.Fragment>
<li>Item, 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
</React.Fragment>
<>
</>

19. How to use styling in react.js?
we can ise inline styles, CSS stylesheets, or CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components.

inline styles
function StyledComponent(){
    return(
        <div
        style={{
            color: "blue",
            backgroundColor: "lightgray"
        }}>
        This is Styled Component.
        </div>
    );
}


styles.css
.container{
    color: blue,
    backgroundColor: lightgray
}
import "./styles.css"
function StyledComponent(){
    return <div className = "container"> this is styled component</div>;
}

20. How can you conditionally render components in React?
We can use Javascript conditional operators (like if, &&, ?:) to conditionally render components.

21. How to render list of data in react?
we can use the map function(ES6) to iterate over an array and render each item.

22. What is Key prop?
The key prop is a unique identifier for each element in a list, used by React to identify which items have changed, are added, or removed.


23. Why indexes for keys are not recommended?
Using indexes as keys can lead to performance issues and unexpected behavior when list items are reordered or removed.
Keys should be unique and stable.

24. How to handle buttons in react?

25. How to handle inputs in react?
we can use controlled components where form data is handled by the component's state.

26. Explain lifecycle methods in react?
Lifecycle methods in React are special methods that get called at different stages of component's lifecycle.
Mounting: When a component is being inserted into the DOM.
Updating: When a component's state or props change.
Unmouting: when a component is being removed from the DOM.

class LifecycleDemo extends React.Component{
    componentDidMount(){
        console.log("component mounted"); //render once only.
    }
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState){ //gives prevProps and prevState
        console.log("component updated"); 
    }

    componentWillUnmount(){
        console.log("component will unmount"); //cleanup things
    }

    render(){
        return <div> Lifecycle method</div>
    }
}

27. What are the popular hooks in react and explain it's usage?

useState: Manages state in functional components.
useEffect: Manages side effects in functional components.
useContext: Consumes context in functional components.
useReducer: Manage state with a reducer function, For More complex state management.
useRef: Accesses DOM elements or stores mutable values.
useCallback: performance improvement usecase
useMemo: performance improvement usecase.

28. What is useState and how to manage state using it?

import React, {useState} from 'react';

function Counter(){
    const [count, setCount]= useState(0);

    return(
        <div>
        <p> you clicked {count} times</p>
        <button onClick={()=>setCount(count+1)}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
    );
}
export default Counter;

29. What is useEffect hook and how to manage side effects?
useEffect is a hook that manages side effects like data fetching(prevState), subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

import React, {useEffect, useState} from 'react';

function DataFetcher(){
    useEffect(()=>{}, [], []); //Empty array means this effect runs only once.

    useEffect(()=>{}, [dependency]); //run if dependency value changes.

  useEffect(()=>{
    return ()=>{};

  }, []) //cleanup method.
  retunr <div></div>;
}
export default Counter;


30. How to implement data fetching in react.js?
ask interviewer question--> how to implement onClick on page load?

31. How to manage loading state?
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

32. What is prop drilling and how to avoid it? What is ContextAPI?
Prop drilling occurs when you pass data through many layers of compoments.
It can be avoided using the Context API or state management libraries like Redux.

A ---> B, C--> D, A-->D.

33. What is Context API in React, and why is it used?
Context API in React provides a way to share values(like data or functions) between components without having 
to pass props through every level of the component tree. It is used to avoid the prop drilling.

import React, {createContext} from 'react';

//create a Context
const MyContext = createContext();

//Provider component

//wrap context in root component.

// A, B, C, D
global state

34. How do you consume context using the useContext hook?
The useContext hook allows functional components to access context values directly.

35. How can you update context values?
//create context
//provider component
//pass context name
//update value by onClick() function.

36. How do you use multiple contexts in a single component?
//we need to wrap multiple context
//useContext(firstContext) and secondContext.

37. What are the advantages of using the Context API over prop drilling?
Context API reduces the need for prop drilling, making the code more readable and maintainable.
It allows for easy sharing of state and functions across the component tree without passing props through every level.

//without Context API(prop drilling)
<Parent>
<Child>
<GrandChild value={value} />
</Child>
</Parent>


//with Context API
<MyProvider>
    <GrandChild />
</MyProvider>


38. What is the useReducer hook, and when should you use it?
The useReducer hook is used for state management in React. 
It is suitable for handling more complex state logic compared to useState.

useReducer alternate of useState.

import React, {useReducer} from 'react';

const[state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
//dispatch action with type property


39. Can you useReducer with complex state objects?
yes.

40. how do you pass additional arguments to the reducer function?

whenever we dispatch action using payload.

dispatch({type: 'update', payload:{value:42}});

41. How to do you handle side effects with useReducer?
Yes
we can useEffect inside the API call with data action.payload.

42. What is useRef Hook?

The useRef hook is used to access and interact with DOM elements directly
and to persist mutable values across renders without causing re-renders.


43. How can useRef be used to store mutuable values?
useRef can store any mutuable values, and changes to the ref do not cause re-renders.

44. What is forwardRef and when would you use it?
forwardRef is a function that allows you to pass refs through components to access DOM elements or child component instances.

45. How to manage forms in react?
Forms in React can be managed using controlled components where form data is handled bu the component's state.

//create JSX structure with form.

46. What are Custom Hooks and why do We Need Them?

Custom Hooks in React are JavaScript functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components.
They enable you to extract and share common logic without repeating code, promoting code reusability and separaration concerns.

c1, c2, c3. c4.c5--> one custom hooks --> state
Advantages:
Code Reusability: Custom hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without duplicating code.
Separation of Concerns: They help spearate the logic from the component's structure, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
Cleaner Code: By Moving common logic into custom hooks, components become cleaner and more focused on their core responsibilites.

47. Implement useFetch custom hook/Custom hook example?

48. Implement useWindowResize custom hook?


49. What is React Router DOM and why is it used?

React Router DOM is a routing library built on top of React Router. 
It enables dynamic routing in web applications, allowing you to define routes and naviagte between different components without reloading the page.

Routing Version 6 latest.
moving 1 page to another page --> routing.

50. How do you create a basic route in React Router DOM?
A basic route is created using the Route component, which maps a URL path to a specific element.
<Route path = "/home" element = {<Home />} />

51. How to implement basic routing using react router dom?

file --> index.js

import {BrowserRouter, Routes, Route} from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => (
    <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
            <Route path="/login" element={<Login />} />
        </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
);

export default App;

52. How to create a link to another route using React Router DOM?
Use the Link component to create navigation links.
import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';

<Link to="/home">Home</Link>
<Link to="/about">About</Link>

53. How do you use URL parameters/ Dynamic routing in React Router DOM?

/product list
1, 2,3, 4,5
<Route path="/user/:userId" element={<User />} />

54. How can you perform a redirect in React Router DOM?
use the Navigate component to perform a redirect.
<Navigate to="/home">;
//use navigate and to property


import {Navigate} from 'react-router-dom';

const Login = ()=>{
    const isLoggedIn = true;
    if(isLoggedIn){
        return <Navigate to="/home">;
    }
    return <div> please login</div>;
}

export default Login;

55. What is a Routes component on React Router DOM?
The Routes component is used to define a set of routes, where only the first matching route is rendered.

<Route path="/home" element={<Home />}

56. How do you handle nested routes in React Router DOM?

<Routes>
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
    <Route path="/home" element={<Home />}
</Routes>

57. How can you handle 404 errors (not found) in React Router DOM?
Use a Route without a path prop inside Routes to catch all unmatched routes.

const NotFound = () => <h1> 404-not found</h1>;

<Route path="*" element={<NotFound />}/>

58. How do you programtically naviagte using React Router DOM?
Use the useNavigate hook to navigate programtically within your components.

import {useNavigate} from 'react-router-dom';

const navigate = useNavigate();
navigate('/home');

59. Explain useCallback hook with example?
//callback function
The useCallback hook is used to memoize callback functions. 
This means that the function provided to useCallback will only be recreated if one of it dependencies has changed.
This is particularly useful when passing callbacks to child components that are optimized with React.memo, as it can prevent unnecessary renders.

60. Explain useMemo hook with example?
The useMemo hook is used to memoize expensive calcualtions so that they are not recalculated on every render.
It takes a function to compute a value and an array of dependencies, and it onlyy recomputes the value when one of the dependencies has changed.

//value

61. Explain React.memo with example?
React.memo is a higher-order component that memoizes the result of a component.
It prevents the component from re-rendering unless the props have changed. 
This is useful for optimizing performance by avoiding unecessary renders of pure components.

62. Explain the Reconciliation process in React and how it works?
Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM efficiently.
It involves comparing the new Virtual DOM with the previous one and determining the minimum number of changes needed to update the actual DOM.

63. What are Pure Components?
PureComponent is a base class in React that implements shouldComponentUpdate with a shallow prop and state comparison.
It helps prevent unnecessary re-renders by ensuring that the component only re-renders when there are actual changes in props or state.

class childComp extends PureComponent{
    //class based components
}

64. Explain higher order component with example?
A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with added functionality.
HOCs are used for reusing component logic and enhancing components with additional behavior.

65. What is redux, explain core principles?
//state management(centralized store)
Redux is a predicatable state container for JavaScript apps. Redux acts as centralized store for state management in your application.
Advantages:
Single Source of Truth: The State of the application is stored in a single object.
State is Read-Only: The only wat to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
Changes are made with Pure Functions: Reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, return the next state.

66. What are actions in Redux, explain with example?
Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened in the application.
They must have a type property that indicates the type of action being performed.

//action.js
export const increment = () => ({type: 'INCREMENT'});
export const decrement = () => ({type: 'DECREMENT'});

67. Explain Reducers in Redux with an example?
Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action , and return a new state based on the action type.

const counterReducer = (state = intitialState, action)=>{
    switch(action.type){
        case 'INCREMENT':
        return {count: state.count +1};
        case 'DECREMENT':
        return {count: state.count - 1};
        default:
        return state;
    }
}

68. What is the role of the Redux Store?
The Store holds the whole state tree of the application. 
It allows access to the state via getState(), dispatching actions via dispatch(action), and registering listeners via subscribe(listener).


69. How do you connect React components to Redux store using connect?
The connect function connects a React component to the Redux store.
It maps state and dispatch to the component's props.

import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({count: state.count});
const mapDispatchToProps = {increment};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);

70. How do you use the useSelector and useDispatch hooks in a functional React component?
useSelector is used to access the Redux state,
const count = useSelector((state)=>state.count)

useDispatch is used to dispatch actions in functional components.

const disptach = useDispatch();

71. What is Redux Toolkit?
Redux Toolkit is an offical, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development.
It simplifies store setup, reduces boilerpate, and includes useful tools like createSlice and createAsyncThunk.

72. How to configure store in redux toolkit?
Redux Toolkit is an official, opinionated toolset for efficient Redux development.
It Simplifies store setup, reduxes biolerplate, and includes useful tools like createSlice and createAsyncThunk.

import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'; //import
const store = configureStore({
    reducer:{
        //pass all reducers
    },
});

export default store;

73. Explain createSlice in Redux Toolkit with an example?
createSlice is a function that generates action creators and action types, and create a reducer based on a object of "slice" reducers.

import {createSlice} from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

74. What are controlled components in React?
Controlled components are React components where the form data is handled by the React state.
The input's value is always driven by the React state.

75. What are uncontrolled components in React?
Uncontrolled components are React Components where the form data is handled by the DOM itself.
The input's value is not driven by the React state.

76. How do you optimize performance in React applications?
    Using useMemo and useCallback to memoize expensive calculations and functions.
    Implementing shouldComponentUpdate or using React.memo for Pure Components.
    Code Splitting and lazy loading.

77. What is code splitting in React?
Code splitting is a feature supported by React that allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand.

import React, {Lazy, Suspense} from 'react';

<Suspense> provides fallback

78. What are render props in React? give an example?
Render props are a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.
This function returns a React element and is used by the component to render part of its output.

79. What are portals in React?
Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
This is useful for things like modals, tooltips and overlays.

80. How do you implement lazy loading in React?
Lazy loading in React can be implemented using the React.lazy and Suspense components.
This allows you to load components on demand, improving initial load times.

81. How do you define props for a functional component in Typescript?

interface Props{}
const MyComponent: React.FC<Props>=({title, count}=>{})

82. How do you use the useState hook with Typescript?
We can define the type of the state variable by specifying it in the useStata generic.

const [count, setCount]= useState<number>(0);

83. How do you type event handlers in React with Typescipt?

const [value, setValue] = useState<string>('');

const handleChange = (e: React.changeEvent<HTMLInputElement>)=>{}
                                           <TextField> <Selectfield>


84. How do you handle optional props in React components with Typescript?
In Typescript, you can handle optional props by using the ? operator in the props interface or type alias.

interface Props{
    subtitle?: string;
}

85. How do you use the useReducer hook with Typescript?

86. How do you type the context API in React with Typescript?

87. How do you write a simple test in Jest?
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook. 
It is commonly used with React because it provides a simple and powerful testing solution with features like snapshot testing, coverage reporting, and built in assertions.

//JEST, RTL

test() or it() callback function.

88. How do you render a component for testing using React Testing Library?

import {render} from '@testing-library/react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
test('renders MyComponent', ()=>{
    render(<MyComponent />);
});

89. How can you find elements in the DOM using the React Testing Library?
//first render the component, then check if we have the text "helloworld" use getByText
//if element toBeIntheDocument();

90. How do you simulate user events in React Testing Library?

//first render the component.
//then fireEvent.click(button);

91. How can you test component props with React Testing Library?
//first render the component.
expect //title present or not.
